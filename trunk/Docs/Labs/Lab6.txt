1.#3.2.1.6                   IP-filtering         not complete         because developer doesn't distribute/settle/appoint what will happen with student's IP.         
2.#3.2.3.2.4 & 3.2.3.2.10    Add New Employee     not unambigious      because these two items contradicts each other.
3.#3.2.1.6.5                 IP-filtering         not unambigious      because there isn't defined from where the IP is taken (from db, etc).
4.#3.2.3.2.3                 Add New Employee     not traceable        because it's hard to analyze,or define after which process system is going to return the registration form.
