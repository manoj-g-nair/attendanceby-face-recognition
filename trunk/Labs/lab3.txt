Screenshot Analysis (Team: "Tera", Project: "Erkemai")


3 main problems we detected:

1. not used special programs for prototype creating programs
2. not clear which page is for what kind of operation
3. screenflow: labels are missing.

2 main benefits:

1.clearly shows what can do that program exactly
2.with screenshots we get more opportunities to construct our program's architecture
